# SystemControl-by-Faceecognition
It's Recognize the Person and Control The AC(alternating Current) Machine and Hardware,Automate Home.
In this project, we have presented face detection and recognition technique in real time camera input environment and further we have tried to control electrical hardware appliance by the same technique.
The entire face recognition algorithm is divided into two modules. The first module is face detection and second is face tracking. To detect the face in the image, Haar based algorithm is used. We try to recognize each of the detected faces as our chosen person.

If successful, draw a green rectangle around the face and display the person name. Otherwise, display Unknown.
